# MacOSSetup

MacOS setup script.

## Executing Script

Before running the script the permissions will need to be changed to make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x setupscript.sh
```

You can then execute the script with the following command.

```bash
bash setupscript.sh
```

__Please Note:__ Running the script with `sudo` will cause the script to fail. This is due to HomeBrew installing packages into `/usr/local`.
